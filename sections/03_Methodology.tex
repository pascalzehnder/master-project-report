\section{Methodology}
Different tools helped us to understand a typical investment process to model the game best for a proper learning of the students. Those tools are described in this section.

\subsection{Requirements Engineering}
The typical requirements engineering builds the base of our engineering design process. By creating user stories we had a common basis to define the requirements toegther with our principals from the DBF. As usual when definining user stories we classified those stories into following three categories: Nice-to-have, Shoul-have, Must-have. Additionally they are structured into different functional or organizational parts. All the stories can be found in the appendix.

\subsection{User Interviews}
Interviews with professionals and other people
Understanding of the overall process

\subsection{Observation of Game Execution}
The game observation was separated in following parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Executive Education Students Observation during their final seminar at the Uetliberg
  \item Observation of different knowledges in one room
  \item Master Seminar: Advanced Portfolio Management Seminar
\end{itemize}
