\section{Application Overview}
For playing a game an administrator of a specified game and an infinite number of teams have to interact together and compete aginast each other.

\subsection{Administration}
All administrative tasks will be described in this part. An administrator may administrate multiple games in one account and the games could be played simultaneously.

\subsubsection{Administrator login}
An administrator needs to have a login for having all adminstrative functionalities. Therefore he has to provide his credentials on the following screen which he reaches by following the instructions on the start page.

\end{center}

\subsubsection{Game management}
\paragraph{Game overview}
As landing page of the administrator the game overview exists. It serves as the control center of the game adminstration. Multiple games can be maintained simultaneously.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/02_game_overview.png}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Game creation}
For creating a game the administrator needs to define some parameters which are structured into three tabs. By pressing on the ''next''-button the administrator will be leaded through the form. Some tooltips help users to understand the purpose of the provided input. After submitting the creation of the game, the user will be redirected to the game detail of the selected game.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/03_game_creation.png}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Game detail}
The game detail for each game may be accessed over the game overview list. In this page a user can intialize period, start periods, having an overview about the teams submission and many other features, which will be described in this part:

\subparagraph{Game initialization}
As the game creation may be done in advance we have splitten the game creation from the game initialization, such that last adjustments of the game may be done just before the start of the game.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/04_game_initialization.png}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Game start}
By starting the game the students or teams are finally able to start with their period 0 decisions. Administrators are able to give them some help over messages which will be visible for the teams in their report section.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/05_game_start.png}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Team overview}
For providing access for all teams an administrator has an overview about the team logins, which are generated automatically when initializing the game.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/06_team_login_overview.png}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Running game}
Overview about the submission state of all teams. The administrator is able to get an insight about the decisions of all submitted teams. The period can only be finished if all teams submitted and therefore the state of the teams has been green.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/07_running_game.png}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Initializing period}
After completion of period zero the administrator has to initalize a period in which the team decisions will be compared to the other teams decisions and evaluated. Additionally new customer types for the next period and other settings could be defined in this phase of the game.
% TODO replace with screen including customer type settings from period 2 e.g.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/08_period_initialization.png}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Period start}
By completing the simulation, respectively evaluation of the previous period, a next period may be started. If the game is still paused the teams cannot access the decisions site. The administrator can define some optional messages which will be displayed in the teams report page. Some adjustments to the simulation results will be edited in this phase of the game.

\end{center}

\subsubsection{Reports}
For presentation of the teams result in between two running periods being played, a report is accessible for the administrator. A more detailed description will be in section X, as the teams access the same reports as the administrator.


\subsubsection{Entities administration}

\paragraph{Assets}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/entities_assets.png}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Asset Types}
A table showing all asset types which may be edited is the landing page of this entity. By editing a specified asset type the administrator can change some characteristics of its type, such as info text.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/administrator/entities_asset_types.png}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Currencies}
The currencies may be edited in a same manner as the asset types.

\paragraph{Customer Types}
An overview about all in the game available customer types is provided for the administrator. For each customer type the ideal strategic asset allocation and the ranges for currencies and asset types (both dimensions) can be modified. Additionaly the info bullets and the displaying name may be modified too.

\end{center}

\paragraph{Sectors}
Short overview about all sectors which are used in the asset overview.

\end{center}

\subsection{Period 0 decisions}
In period 0 which represents phase 1 of the game, the teams define their SAA for all customer types which are enabled by the administrator of the specific game. The teams need to fullfill the ranges for all dimensions to submit their decisions. Supportive graphs in form of pie charts help the teams to decide about the share of the two dimensions. Additionaly the players can name their team on the top left corner of the screen.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/teams/02_period_zero_decisions.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Other periods decisions}
Starting from period 1, a team has to complete multiple decisions separated into four pages. A strategic asset allocation is fixed and non editable for a customer type which was defined at the beginning of the game. When the administrator defines a new customer type for an upcoming period, the teams have to allocate an SAA for the new customer type.\\

For each step within this process, a progress state helps the teams to understand the state of each step. For saving their decisions, all four steps have to be completed. In the bottom left corner the submission state may be seen.

\subsubsection{TAA}
For the tactical asset allocation the teams can deviate from the SAA due to changes in the overall market. Equal to the strategic asset allocation screen the teams change the input within the table and get a illustrative support with two graphs, displaying the allocations for both dimensions of the table. Initially the inputs from the strategic asset allocation are loaded, whereas the students can adjust them to market changes. Arrows within the total summation of each asset type or currency show the status of being within the range.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/application-overview/teams/04_taa.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Depot Realization}
Based on SAA and TAA the teams finally have to allocate on specific assets. By having a bar chart on the top of the screen, students have an overview about their SAA and TAA decisions of the current active customer type. A target for the students is to allocate assets such taht the yellow bar aligns with TAA for each asset type/currency combination. On the top right corner a short summary about the most important key numbers for the allocations is present.
% TODO table description with filters etc.
This process has to be repeated for each customer type defined by navigating on the left menu. Equal to the SAA and TAA screen, the progress of the customer types is highlighted with checkmarks and corresponding colors.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\subsubsection{Business Administration}
Business administration operates as the final decisions for a period. On the left side of the screen teams input numbers for four different categories: Conditions \& Fees, Human ressources, logistics and profit ditribution. For each input field the intial value (in period 1) or the previous period value (for all other periods) is displayed next to the input field.\\

On the right side the balance sheet from the previous period is visualized to inform teams about their business results. Further key information is displayed on top of the balance sheet.
